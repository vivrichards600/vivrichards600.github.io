The world is a strange place at the moment and rather than talk about all the gloom and doom I wanted to share hopefully a couple of helpful distractions. 

Now could be the perfect time whilst we are being asked to self isolate to spend maybe just 30 minutes a day and learn something new or brush up on some old skills perhaps?

## Testing Playgrounds
1. [The sweet shop](https://sweetshop.netlify.com/) is an intentionally broken web application that invites you to explore and brush up on some of your testing skills. Whether you want to try out some DevTools, practice accessibility or perhaps you just want an application to write some UI test automation against.
2. [Test Pages For Automating](https://testpages.herokuapp.com/styled/index.html) is a set of pages for automating or testing created by [Alan Richardson](https://twitter.com/eviltester). Some of the examples are suitable for manual exploratory testing or JavaScript hacking. 
[Alan also has created quite a few more games, apps and tools which you may find interesting](https://www.eviltester.com/page/tools/).
3. [The testers playground](https://testersplayground.herokuapp.com/) contains various free challenges designed to help testers learn as well as challenge their current knowledge and skills.
4. [Restful-Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/) is an API playground created by [Mark Winteringham](https://twitter.com/2bittester) for those wanting to learn more about API testing and tools.
5. [Testing Challenges](http://testingchallenges.thetestingmap.org/) created by Draghia Claudiu contains lots of testing puzzles that you can work through. Challenges range from web testing to completing a crossword puzzle with testing techniques.

## Courses

1. [Pluralsight are giving people free access to 7,000+ expert-led video courses all month long as part of #FreeApril](https://www.pluralsight.com/offer/2020/free-april-month). This is usually Â£24 pound per month to access these great courses. They have some really great courses on UI testing, programming fundamentals and also specific things like iOS app testing and testing react applications.
2. [TestAutomation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/) if you haven't heard about it already, is a great FREE site and initiative setup by [Angie Jones](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908) of [AppliTools](https://applitools.com/) where she has world-class industry leaders specifically in the testing space create some fantastic courses which they make available for free. Again you can learn so many different things like programming fundamentals in Java with [Angie Jones](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908), API testing with Postman with [Amber Race](https://twitter.com/ambertests), Automating in the browser with [Alan Richardson](https://twitter.com/eviltester) as well as so many other things; Visual testing, Cypress... the list goes on - check it out.
