I've recently been involved in helping build a number of digital services at the [DVLA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency) (Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency). Each of the services that are built have to look consistent with the rest of [GOV UK](http://gov.uk) and so have to follow the [Government Service Design Manual](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/) (Government Digital Services). I really enjoy using Pencil and thought I'd create some Stencils to enable people to quickly and easily create Government Digital Service prototypes for new services.

In order to make your prototype look consistent with GOV UK services you will need to use the Transport font. [Download Transport font](http://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/Transport_Medium.htm).

## Installing the App Stencils

In order to use the App Stencils you will need to install Pencil and also download the Mobile UI stencils by following the below steps:

* copy Transports fonts to C:\Windows\Fonts
* open Pencil
* within Pencil click on the 'My Stuff' tab
