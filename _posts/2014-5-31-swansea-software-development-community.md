After being introduced and inspired by the contageous [Sandro Mancuso](https://codurance.com/blog/author/sandro-mancuso/), I've decided to set-up a free meet-up for anybody involved in delivering software.

The meet-up is absolutely free to attend and is a great chance to learn, share and network as well as enjoy some free pizza and drinks courtesy of our sponsor [Valtech](http://valtech.com). The first event will take place at the [TechHub](https://swansea.techhub.com/), Swansea. The event will run the last Monday of each month and you can find out what's on the agenda by visiting the meetup page [www.meetup.com/swansea-software-development-community](http://www.meetup.com/swansea-software-development-community).

The communities first event will be on the 30th June 2014 - to take a look at what this community is about please go to the Swansea Software Development Community meetup page. The event is limited to space so is on a first come first served basis so signup today if you are interested.
