I"#<p>When performing accessibility testing I try to use a combination of tools and techniques to find potential violations. One of the tools I really enjoy using to support accessibility testing is axe. Axe is available in a few different forms. Personally I tend to use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd">axe browser extension</a> to support exploratory testing as well as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/cli">@axe-core/cli</a> to help automate identifying potential violations.</p>

<p>One issues I often have whether I am using the browser extension or cli is that the output the tools give me are very difficult to easily read as it outputs violation results in a .JSON file.</p>

<p>I recently released a new tool to instantly generate HTML accessibility reports using the .json that is output by axe-core cli.</p>

<p>In the below video I show how to generate a .JSON file from @axe-core/cli and then how to generate a HTML report from it using this tool.</p>
