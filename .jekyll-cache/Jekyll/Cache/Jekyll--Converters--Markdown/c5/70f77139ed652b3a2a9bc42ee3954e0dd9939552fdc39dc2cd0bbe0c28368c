    <p>C.A.R - the idea of car driving forward user stories</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Roads are created to help cars (devs) stay on the straight and narrow, driving down paths agreed but leaving them with space to design code that will enable them to avoid pot holes and pedestrians possibly that step in to the roadâ€¦</p>

<p>How to help with these issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start with why
    <ul>
      <li>Why are we doing this?? What is it the business actually expects at the end of delivering this â€˜thingâ€™</li>
    </ul>
