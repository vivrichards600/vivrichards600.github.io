I"Ø<p>Due to the massive price on tickets for software conferences and with the nearest ones being as far as London, Iâ€™ve decided to attempt to run one myself here in Swansea. There are quite a few things which are a bit â€˜iffyâ€™ and could go wrong but Iâ€™m going to chance itâ€¦</p>

<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™ve never been to a conference</li>
  <li>I have little money</li>
  <li>I canâ€™t find anybody else who will take a chance on this and help out</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m unsure if people will come to speak or buy tickets to attend</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t know the running costs to put on something like this</li>
</ul>

<p>So yeah, Iâ€™m up against it a bit but Iâ€™m going to give it a go. My aim is to try get speakers to come from all over the world to speak in little old Swansea. The venue is still to be confirmed and I will shortly be putting out a call for speakers to see if I can get anyone to come along and speak! I hope to reach out to local businesses to help sponsor the event as reach out in a local meetup I run - <a href="http://meetup.com/swansea-software-development-community">Swansea software Development Community</a>.</p>
