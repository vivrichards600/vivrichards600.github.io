I"ü<p>Following on from my previous two blog posts that explored <a href="2022-06-18-gaming-heardle-the-art-of-keeping-things-simple.md">how to automate guessing Heardle</a> and <a href="2022-06-20-listening-to-previous-days-or-upcoming-heardle.md">listening to a previous or upcoming Heardle</a>, in this post I explore how to alter Heardle to achieve a perfect score.</p>

  <p><strong>Spoiler Alert</strong>: The following information explains how to alter your daily Heardle stats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The aim of this post isnâ€™t to encourage cheating at the game. Instead, I want to share some ideas about exploring an application and how it can be manipulated to behave in a way that isnâ€™t how the developer(s) of the game intended.</p>

<p>Sometimes, no matter how long you spend listening to the first second of a Heardle, it just isnâ€™t enough. It can be so frustrating. Yesterday I wasnâ€™t 100% on the Heardle for the day and so decided to click the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Skip</code> button to hear another second of it. After the additional second played, I got it. Doh! I should have known this one, and now Iâ€™ve lost my perfect score for the dayâ€¦</p>

<p>As a reminder of your guesses, Heardle provides its users with an overview of their scores. Within the stats window, you can see the number of Heardles youâ€™ve guessed, and they get grouped by the number of attempts it took you to guess. My daily Heardle of the day was now showing two attempts.</p>

<p>This got me thinking, is it possible to change a Heardle score? What if we could hide the fact we had to skip when guessing the Heardle to get a perfect score for the day?</p>

<p>When I explore a web application, one of the tools I really love using is DevTools. DevTools contains many tools that can help you in your day-to-day testing of web applications and are built into the web browser. Iâ€™m not going to talk much about how to use DevTools in this post, but if youâ€™d like to learn more about DevTools and how to use it to generate new test ideas, why not check out my course over on the Ministry of Testing site.</p>

<p>To start on my mission of a perfect score, with <a href="https://heardle.app">Heardle</a> opened within my Chrome web browser I right-clicked and inspected the page. One of the things I often do when I see that a web application is storing information on my usage is that I like to go to the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/#application">Application panel within DevTools</a>. Within this panel, there are a number of different things you can look at. When I use this panel I like to look at the Cookies and Local Storage.</p>

<p>When inspecting the Heardle page and looking at the Cookies panel there were some entries for Heardle. After a closer inspection, sadly only Google Analytic information was being stored here for Heardle. Next, I headed over to the Local Storage section.</p>

<p>The Local Storage API is used by some web applications as a way to store, retrieve, and track changes to user data. Within this panel, there were two entries for Heardle. One called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstTime</code>, with a value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>, and the other called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userStats</code> which contained some interesting-looking JSON.</p>

<p><img src="/images/viewing-local-storage.png" alt="Viewing local storage for Heardle" /></p>

<p>I altered the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstTime</code> value and reloaded the page. The behaviour changed as if it was the very first time I had opened Heardle with a how-to-play splash screen being displayed. Whilst this showed the splash screen, my stats were unchanged.</p>

<p>Next, I looked at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userStats</code> JSON value. There was lots of interesting information:</p>

<pre>
[
  {
    "id": 116,
    "guessList": [
      {
        "answer": "",
        "isCorrect": false,
        "isSkipped": true,
        "isArtist": false,
        "playCount": 1
      },
      {
        "answer": "The Foundations - Build Me Up Buttercup",
        "isCorrect": true,
        "isSkipped": false,
        "isArtist": false,
        "playCount": 1
      }
    ],
    "hasFinished": true,
    "hasStarted": true,
    "img": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-hnz9Jtey8tXv-0-large.jpg",
    "gotCorrect": true,
    "score": 2
  }
]
</pre>

<p>From looking through the JSON value there were some interesting things being stored. A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guessList</code> which seemed to keep track of the number of attempts and also because I had got the Heardle on my second attempt, there were some values to indicate Iâ€™d finished the Heardle (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"hasFinished": true</code>), got the answer correct (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"gotCorrect": true</code>) and that it took me two guesses (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"score": 2</code>)</p>

<p>I wanted to start modifying the JSON value, in particular the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guessList</code>. I copied the entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userStats</code> JSON value and pasted it into <a href="https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print">a free online JSON formatter</a> so that I could easily view and modify the structure. Next, using the online editor I removed the contents within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">]</code> for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guessList</code>. I also changed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">score</code> value to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>. Then I clicked on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Make Pretty</code> button on the online formatter, copied the formatted JSON and pasted it into the Local Storage, over-writing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userStats</code> value.</p>

<p>I reloaded the webpage and clicked on my stats. A perfect score!</p>

<p><img src="/images/heardle-alter-score.gif" alt="heardle.app altering score" /></p>

<p>When exploring, I also purposely removed all of my Local Storage to see what other things we might want to do. One scenario was getting to a point where you use all your skips and so you run out of turns and the Heardle is revealed.</p>

<p>In this scenario, you could modify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userStats</code> JSON value and just remove the days Heardle. You can do this by amending the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guessList</code>. To do this you would remove the JSON starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ "id:</code> (make sure you remove the correct Heardle) down to the closing bracket <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">}</code> just after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"score":</code> value for the Heardle.</p>

<p>Now you could listen to the song again, put in the correct song and get the correct answer in one guess ;-).</p>
