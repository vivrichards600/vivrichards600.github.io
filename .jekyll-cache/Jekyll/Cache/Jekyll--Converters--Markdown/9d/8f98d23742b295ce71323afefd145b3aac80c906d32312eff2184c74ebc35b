I"5	<p>I’ve not used <a href="http://pencil.evolus.vn/">Pencil</a> in a while but thought I’d download it again to try and quickly put together a few prototypes for a new mobile app idea I had.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pencil is built for the purpose of providing a free and open-source GUI prototyping tool that people can easily install and use to create mockups in popular desktop platforms. Using Pencil you can install stencils which give you elements to use in your wire-frames for Android 4.0 (ICS), iOS Wireframe, iOS GUI, Bootstrap or alternatively you can create your own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I played around for a while with the stencils which come with Pencil but nothing really caught my eye and so I decided I’d create some of my own inspried by some of the great iOs and Android apps I’ve used or seen recently.</p>

<p>Below is a mock-up of some of the types of screens you can create with the free Stencil pack I’ve created. I hope you like the look of the various elements which you can use to play around with new ideas and create some great looking apps which are a joy to use.</p>
