I"<p>Accessibility is about making sure everybody, regardless of their abilities can access, understand, and navigate web content, regardless of how they’re accessing it. It is recommended that accessibility testing is conducted throughout the design and development process.</p>

<p>I’ve previously blogged a little about accessibility, but in this blog post I share a number of different ways in which you can start to automate testing for accessibility. It’s important to note that although we will be looking at various ways to automate catching accessibility errors, these do not guarantee that your site is accessible. The absence of errors DOES NOT mean your page is accessible or compliant. Always combine automated testing with ongoing manual testing. Manual testing is the most reliable method to assess accessibility.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-access">Keyboard access</h2>

<p>These guidelines cover a number of things like are you able to reach everything that’s interactive using the tab key? Can you also interact with the elements using space-bar, enter key, are things focusable, labeled appropriately etc. It’s important because a user may be unable to use a mouse; instead, they may use just the keyboard to navigate the web.</p>

<p>When thinking about testing the tabbing, sure you you could simply load up your web application and tab through each field, but what if we could start to quickly visualise this, or maybe we may still want to tab through manually but save the visual flow to attach to a story we are testings?</p>

<p>I’ve previously written a few ways you could do this using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromelens/idikgljglpfilbhaboonnpnnincjhjkd?hl=en">ChromeLens</a> and/or using <a href="https://github.com/eviltester/usefuljssnippetextension">JavaScript</a> in the browser which you can find here - <a href="https://vivrichards.co.uk/accessibility/automating-page-tab-flows-using-visual-testing-and-javascript">Automating page tabability</a>.</p>

<h2 id="page-structure">Page structure</h2>

<p>These guidelines look to see whether you are using semantic elements and roles. It’s important because a user of your site may be low-sighted and so may need to navigate around the page by jumping to the page section they want to get to.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE browser extension</a> is available for both Chrome and Firefox. After installing the tool simply navigate to the page you want to check and then press the WAVE icon within your toolbar. “You will notice a new sidebar popup and WAVE will present your page with embedded icons and indicators. Each icon, box, and piece of information added by WAVE presents some information about the accessibility of your page.”</p>

<p>Within the sidebar you can view details of the structual elements of your page, view the structure of the page as well as switch off styles in order to see whether the page is structured in a logical way.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wave-page-structure.gif" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>It’s also possible to check if your page is structured in a logical by disabling all stylesheets using a little bit of JavaScript. <a href="http://localhost:4000/accessibility/removing-style-sheets">Click here to view my previous post on this method</a>.</p>

<p>As well as offering a nice way to visualise the tab flow through your application (mentioned above), ChromeLens also offers ‘Lenses’, visual impairment simulation. This tool lets you see how the page looks through the eyes of someone with vision issues.</p>

<p><img src="/images/chrome-lenses.gif" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>Using the ‘Lenses’ simulator you can test for a whole range of issues which can help to flag up issues. An example where I’ve found ‘Lenses’ handy is where a system relied on colour in order to inform a user that there had been a problem. The application showed red text and a red border around an input to show there had been an error rather than displaying a meaningful error message to the user.</p>
